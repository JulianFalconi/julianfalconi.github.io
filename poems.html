        </br>
        <div class="numbers">  <i>26</i>, 3</div>

        Why isn’t <i>this</i> enough?</br></br>

        Riobamba is where I fell in love with the world. </br>
        If ever there was music in my childhood, </br>
        I hear it here — where walls flaunt</br>
        brick more than paint, </br>
        where people work to live</br>
        and not the other way around,</br>
        where the valley that cradles me,</br>
        lying between the static of Chambo </br>
        and the roaring weekend cheers of Licto,</br>
        nourishes numberless singularities </br>
        equally unique and deserving of life. </br>
        </br>
        Gonzalo tells me he lost twenty years. </br>
        We dare not count the hours </br>
        that rival seeding harvests,</br>
        cultivating, and waiting.</br>
        Yet, I've learned those hours</br>
        are time found and bound </br>
        to the sound of a living made hopeful, </br>
        by the very ground I left long ago.</br>
          </br>
        I have yet to shoe Oettinger, </br>
        carve a path through the thick </br>
        between the orange and lemon trees, </br>
        find homes for six strays born at my doorstep,</br>
        build that fire pit I see lighting the ring of land </br>
        behind the workshop,</br>
        fish…</br>
        </br>
        By the rushing water of a river moving nowhere fast,</br>
        the fourty-something days it takes grass to dull my steps, </br>
        and the man who has lost my life's time in his, </br>
        what’s the rush?</br>
          </br>
        </br>

        <p class="title" "poem">34 DAYS OF OLD ENTISH</p>

        Livings waiting to be sold - </br>
        they have forgotten their love</br>
        for growing things.</br>
        They search for roots </br>
        hoping they’ll withstand </br>
        those indifferent gasps of their own kind - </br>
        circumstantially, fixing on lots to erect themselves upon</br>
         as if Probability didn’t forge from something close to nothing. </br>
        </br>
        If only they took more time</br>
        to eat earth, </br>
        dig deep, </br>
        drink water,</br>
        and sleep.</br>
        </br>
        Seeds, </br>
        periods to forgotten verses, </br>
        someone and anyone where the Music of the Ainur</br>
        planted an end to a sentence of earth, </br>
        the magnitude of all pasts </br>
        is today. </br>

    <p class="title" "poem">"NEVER"</p>
        </br>
        The cry of the heart isn't heard,  </br>
        it's felt. Sometimes, laying it bare  </br>
        at the innermost angles of the eyes,  </br>
        a shine crawls with each breath </br>
        that fails to bail the flooding chest.  </br></br>
        Oh, how a professed end to "maybe" </br>
        can twist a heart and wring out rain</br>
        from unspoken words </br>
        twixt woven vocal chords. </br>
        </br>
        </br>


      <p class="title" "poem">POEMS</p>

      </br>
      They come and go.</br>
      Some, couple and I don’t know</br>
      which is which.</br>
      Some, light</br>
      for the last time before my eyes.</br>
      I hone in on the dark, </br>
      searching through the abyss of my pupils</br>
      for a spark.</br>
      </br>
      But,</br>
      through time,</br>
      none remain the same.</br>
      The words I frame:</br>
      fireflies,</br>
      romancing in the night.</br>
      </br>

      <p class="title" "poem">ABSENCE </br> MARK II - MEMORIES</p> </br>

      Fire of life, </br>
      oh, how your speckled flares of light spellbind my eyes </br>
      despite my mind’s perception of the surrounding night </br>
      that may be, is, and maybe was, </br>
      time. </br>

  <p class="title" "poem">HURTING</p>

    I felt roots, </br>
    she saw dirt. </br>

      <p class="title" "poem">TODAY</p>

        Livings wait to be sold - we have forgotten how to forge.  </br>
        Cashing living for livings, we search </br>
        for roots that may withstand those indifferent gasps of society. </br>
        Circumstantially, we fix on lots to erect ourselves upon </br>
        as if Probability didn’t forge from something close to nothing.  </br>
          </br>
        Nature, </br>
        daughter of Time, </br>
        inhales before us; </br>
        a cloud ends to begin anew, </br>
        a stain rejoices at an excavated smile, </br>
        and a steady breeze ventures to feel, </br>
        each, moored fragments of wisdom
        in Her breath. </br>
        </br>
        A seed,  </br>
        like a period of a forgotten verse, is someone and anyone  </br>
        where God’s pen planted an end to a sentence of earth, </br>
        like the magnitude of all pasts </br>
        is today. </br>

        <p class="title" "poem">PAINTING</p>
        The canvas is worked brown</br>
        within a frame of green,</br>
          </br>
        sloping veins are etched to be darkened </br>
        by glistening voyages of domesticated water, </br>
         </br>
        and paint is buried  </br>
          </br>
        to be rendered by strokes of life </br>
        and those who know sustenance </br>
        in color. </br>  </br>
