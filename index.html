    <strong>PANTAÑO</strong><br>
    <br>
    by Julian Falconi<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>Dedicated to my  friends and family,<br>
    whose love’s given wings<br>
    to the length of my life.<br><br>
    And to the young,<br>
    who must find perspective<br>
    in priority.<br></i>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Pantaño</strong> is the small valley where I spent my early childhood and live now.  <br>It is named after a small agricultural village nearby.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>WOUNDED</strong><br><br>
    I do not create from pain,<br>
    it saps out of me;<br>
    I am not the perturbed artist,<br>
    I am the steady tree.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>BLISS</strong> <i>(for Chimborazo)</i><br><br>
    I wake in Riobamba,<br>
    exit the house, and witness:<br>
    morning light warm<br>
    this rugged Andean quilt,<br>
    moist air nourish<br>
    the God of Snow,<br>
    souls stir life  <br>
    into the coming journey…<br>
    then the cars.<br>
    The fucking cars.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>STILL THERE</strong><br><br>
    I used to think Venezuela was fading<br>
    under a corrupt government, narcotraffic, <br>
    and a coin torn into millions. <br><br>
    “I miss it all,” said an engineer<br>
    selling coconuts on the side of the road.<br>
    “My family, the food, the air, the sun…”<br><br>
    I wondered about its souls,<br>
    uprooted and scattered<br>
    across these Andean veins:<br><br>
    upon sleeping,<br>
    how many still breathe that air, <br>
    beneath that sun?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>LOVE, IN HINDSIGHT</strong><br><br>
    I struggled against the tide<br>
    as your salty back split the ocean<br>
    and the castle crumbled through my fingers.<br>
    If only I had turned to face the sunset<br>
    beside you, my friend.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>SHAME</strong><br><br>
    It’s not the fact.<br>
    It’s the electrity<br>
    that simmers before,<br>
    surges during,<br>
    and flows after.<br>
    <br>
    It’s not the fact.<br>
    It’s the music;<br>
    it’s the song that takes<br>
    you and I<br>
    and makes us.<br>
    <br>
    It’s not the fact.<br>
    It’s the beat my heart beats for<br>
    I see seek shelter<br>
    from the eyes<br>
    of others.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>EXPERIENCE</strong><br><br>
    When people hear I’m a college dropout<br>
    some express concern,<br>
    most look down,<br>
    and few look up.<br>
    I prefer those who<br>
    simply don’t give a fuck.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>SUFICIENTE</strong><br>
    <br>
    Me he dado cuenta sobre el tiempo que nos queda<br>
    que aunque nunca fue mucho<br>
    por lo menos antes<br>
    menos<br>
    era más.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>GOING ON A POEM</strong><br><br>
    <p class="right">
    I<br>
    flipped<br>
    the switch<br>
    and the lights<br>
    remained off. I<br>
    told my boss and<br>
    she told Mari, who<br>
    cleans. She came by,<br>
     flipped the switch too<br>
    to no avail, but left. Then,<br>
    an older man came by, flipped<br>
    the switch and also left shadowless.<br>
    So,<br>
    here I am again, dropping the sails for<br>
    another voyage in the dark.<br>
