  <p class="title" "lyrics">STRAY CHILLING</p>

    If I gave you my name,</br>
    would you give me a call?</br>
    Would you forget about it all </br>
    and just feel the fall?</br>
    Just feel the fall.</br>
</br>
    Cause we're all passengers</br>
    of the head and the heart;</br>
    well, mine are floating down a river</br>
    fishing for ideas to fill.</br>
    Oh, they're floating down the river</br>
    fishing for ideas to fill. </br>
</br>
    You may say I'm</br>
    pushing up a rock,</br>
    but I feel more like a stray dog </br>
    soaking sun up at the dock.</br>
    Oh, I might as well be a stray dog</br>
    soaking sun up at the dock.</br>
    Oh, I might as well be a stray dog</br>
    soaking sun up at the dock.</br>

      <p class="stitle" "ss">THINGS THAT STOP YOU DREAMING
      </p>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We should sell this one for two dollars.” said Adam, marking his gaze by pointing at a silver fish in a 12 oz ziplock bag; his ignorance had not yet cared to learn its proper name, but he singled it out by the two horizontal streaks of highlighter yellow that gleamed across its body. “What do you think, Nico?”</br>

    	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nico stumbled out of the bathroom in nothing but his Pikachu underpants and, with a sluggish face-plant, introduced the starry night of mud stains on his forehead to his bed. After struggling to breathe into his sheets, he rolled onto his back and caught his breath. “That fish is the reason I’m practically naked!” he declared at the ceiling. “Let’s sell it for three, that way I can keep an extra dollar for my sacrifice.”</br>

    	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAdam chuckled and stood up. “Alright then, prices are set. Tadpoles and fish with one streak sell for a dollar and,” extending his arm to lift the fish just above eye level,“this beautiful bastard for three. Anyways, Andrea’s coming over for a math lesson with mom soon, so I’m off to shower. You should probably do the same,” he smirked and raised his eyebrows towards Nico’s face-plant silhouette, “judging by that mess on your bed.”</br>

    	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp“Shit…”</br>

    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp	“Yeah,” Adam validated his little brother’s disappointing realisation, “mom won’t be too happy about that. I’ll use her bathroom so you can wash up too.”</br>

    	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Within a half hour both kids were dirt-free and back in clean soccer shorts and t-shirts, Nico had flipped his duvet, and Andrea had started to realise how pizza and mathematics may be related.</br>

    	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So if there’s two pizzas for eight people, we’d have to cut each pizza into four slices!” exclaimed Andrea, turning her back to the circles and stick figures Ms. Rivero suggested she draw. Her greyish-brown hair spun around her pivot, revealing the half of her neck it usually covered, then swayed back into place with her stop.  She eagerly looked to Ms. Rivero, who was sitting at Adam’s desk, for a final seal of approval.</br>

    	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp“Exactly dear! Now, let’s run through some practice problems.” said Ms. Rivero as she cleared the white board. She was two digits into writing out a problem when Adam walked in the room to check up on them.</br>

      <p class="title" "poem">TODAY</p>
        Livings wait to be sold - </br>
         we have forgotten how to forge.  </br>
        Cashing living for livings, we go searching </br>
        for roots that may withstand those indifferent gasps of somber society. </br>
        Circumstantially, we fix on lots to erect ourselves upon </br>
        as if Probability didn’t forge from something close to nothing.  </br>
          </br>
        Mother Nature, </br>
        daughter of Time, </br>
        breathes before us: </br>
        a cloud ends to begin anew, </br>
        a stain rejoices at an excavated smile, </br>
        and a steady breeze ventures to embrace folds in space, </br>
        each, exhaling moored fragments of ever-flowing wisdom. </br>
          </br>
        A tree,  </br>
        like a period of a forgotten verse, is someone and anyone  </br>
        where God’s pen planted an end to a sentence of earth, </br>
        like the magnitude of all pasts </br>
        is today. </br>

    </br>
     </br>

        <p class="title" "poem">PAINTING</p>
        The canvas is worked brown</br>
        within a frame of green,</br>
          </br>
        sloping veins are etched to be darkened </br>
        by glistening voyages of domesticated water, </br>
         </br>
        and paint is buried  </br>
          </br>
        to be rendered by strokes of life </br>
        and those who know sustenance </br>
        in color. </br>  </br>   </br>

        <p class="title" "poem">ABSCENCE</p>
        Firefly,</br>  </br>
        we used to build fires every night.</br></br>
        Oh,</br></br>
        how such a sparse set of light</br></br>
        in the night of time
        could </br></br>
        inadvertently spellbind</br></br>
        what I know is dark,</br></br></br></br></br></br>
        so bright</br></br></br></br></br></br>
          . </br></br>
