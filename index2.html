      <p class="title" "poem">DURMIENDO EN VENEZUELA</p>

        Pensaba que Venezuela se desvanecía </br>
        bajo un gobierno corrupto, el narcotráfico,</br>
        y una moneda deshaciéndose en millones.</br>
    </br>
        “Lo extraño todo”, dijo un estudiante </br>
        vendiendo cocos.</br>
        “Mi familia, </br>
        la comida, </br>
        el aire, </br>
        el sol…”</br>
    </br>
        Al subirme al carro, me pregunte de sus almas </br>
        desarraigadas, dispersas sobre estas venas Andinas:</br>
        al dormir, cuantas todavía respiran ese aire,</br>
        bajo ese sol?</br></br>



      <p class="title" "poem">SLEEPING IN VENEZUELA</p>

        I used to think Venezuela was fading</br>
        under a corrupt government, narcotraffic, </br>
        and a coin vanishing into millions. </br>
    </br>
        “I miss it all,” said a former student</br>
        selling coconuts.</br>
        “My family,</br>
        the food,</br>
        the air, </br>
        the sun…”</br>
    </br>
        After climbing into my car, I wondered about its souls,</br>
        uprooted and scattered across these Andean veins:</br>
        upon sleeping, how many still breathe that air, </br>
        beneath that sun?</br></br>

      <p class="title" "poem">WHAT'S THE RUSH?</p>

          Why isn’t <i>this</i> enough?</br></br>

          Pantaño is where I fell in love with the world. </br>
          If ever there was music in my childhood, </br>
          I hear it here — where walls flaunt</br>
          brick more than paint, </br>
          where people work to live</br>
          and not the other way around,</br>
          where the valley that cradles me,</br>
          lying between the static of Chambo </br>
          and the roaring weekend cheers of Licto,</br>
          nourishes numberless singularities </br>
          equally unique and deserving of life. </br>
          </br>
          Gonzalo tells me he lost twenty years</br>
          to a bitter spell of injustice.</br>
          We dare not count the hours </br>
          that rival seeding harvests,</br>
          cultivating, and waiting.</br>
          Yet, I've learned those hours</br>
          are time found and bound </br>
          to the sound of a living made hopeful, </br>
          by the very ground I left long ago.</br>
            </br>
          I have yet to shoe Oettinger, </br>
          carve a path through the thick </br>
          between the orange and lemon trees, </br>
          find homes for six strays born at my doorstep,</br>
          build that fire pit I see lighting the ring of land </br>
          behind the workshop,</br>
          fish…</br>
          </br>
          By the rushing water of a river moving nowhere fast,</br>
          the fourty-something days it takes grass to dull my steps, </br>
          and the man who has lost my life's time in his, </br>
          what’s the rush?</br>
            </br>
          </br>

          <p class="title" "poem">34 DAYS OF OLD ENTISH</p>

          Livings wait to be sold - </br>
          they have forgotten their love</br>
          for growing things.</br>
          They search for roots </br>
          hoping they’ll withstand </br>
          those indifferent gasps of their own kind - </br>
          circumstantially, fixing on lots to erect themselves upon</br>
           as if Probability didn’t forge from something close to nothing. </br>
          </br>
          If only they took more time</br>
          to eat earth, </br>
          dig deep, </br>
          drink water,</br>
          and sleep.</br>
          </br>
          Seeds, </br>
          periods to forgotten verses, </br>
          anyone, someone, where the Music of the Ainur</br>
          planted an end to a sentence of earth, </br>
          the magnitude of all pasts </br>
          is today. </br>

      <p class="title" "poem">"NEVER"</p>
          </br>
          The cry of the heart isn't heard,  </br>
          it's felt. Sometimes, laying it bare  </br>
          at the innermost angles of the eyes,  </br>
          a shine crawls beneath each breath </br>
          that fails to bail the flooding chest.  </br></br>
          Oh, how a professed end to "maybe" </br>
          can twist a heart and wring out rain</br>
          from unspoken words caught  </br>
          twixt woven vocal chords. </br>
          </br>
          </br>

          </br>
          They come and go.</br>
          Some, couple and I don’t know</br>
          which is which.</br>
          Some, light</br>
          for the last time before my eyes.</br>
          I hone in on the dark, </br>
          searching through the abyss of my pupils</br>
          for a spark.</br>
          </br>
          But,</br>
          through time,</br>
          none remain the same.</br>
          The words I frame:</br>
          fireflies,</br>
          romancing in the night.</br>
          </br>

          <p class="title" "poem">ABSENCE </br> MARK II - MEMORIES</p> </br>

          Fire of life, </br>
          oh, how your speckled flares spellbind my eyes </br>
          despite my mind’s perception of the surrounding night </br>
          that may be, is, and maybe was, </br>
          time. </br>

    <p class="title" "lyrics">STRAY</p>

      If I gave you my name,</br>
      would you give me a call?</br>
      But, first, forget about it all </br>
      and just feel the fall.</br>
      Just feel the fall.</br>
    </br>
      We're all passengers</br>
      of the head and the heart;</br>
      mine are floating down the river</br>
      fishing for ideas to fill.</br>
      Oh, I'm floating down the river</br>
      fishing for ideas to fill. </br>
    </br>
      Some may think I'm </br>
      pushing up a rock,</br>
      but I feel more like a stray dog </br>
      soaking sun up at the dock.</br>
      Oh, I might as well be a stray dog</br>
      soaking sun up at the dock.</br>
      Oh, freedom is a stray dog</br>
      soaking sun up at the dock.</br></br></br>

              <p class="title" "poem">TODAY</p>

                Livings wait to be sold - we have forgotten how to forge.  </br>
                Cashing living for livings, we search </br>
                for roots that may withstand those indifferent gasps of society. </br>
                Circumstantially, we fix on lots to erect ourselves upon </br>
                as if Probability didn’t forge from something close to nothing.  </br>
                  </br>
                Nature, </br>
                daughter of Time, </br>
                inhales before us; </br>
                a cloud ends to begin anew, </br>
                a stain rejoices at an excavated smile, </br>
                and a steady breeze ventures to feel, </br>
                each, moored fragments of wisdom </br>
                in Her breath. </br>
                </br>
                A seed,  </br>
                like a period of a forgotten verse, is someone and anyone  </br>
                where God’s pen planted an end to a sentence of earth, </br>
                like the magnitude of all pasts </br>
                is today. </br>

          <p class="title" "poem">PAINTING</p>
          The canvas is worked brown</br>
          within a frame of green,</br>
            </br>
          sloping veins are etched to be darkened </br>
          by glistening voyages of domesticated water, </br>
           </br>
          and paint is buried  </br>
            </br>
          to be rendered by strokes of life </br>
          and those who know sustenance </br>
          in color. </br>  </br>   </br>
